# C - Debugging

I learned about debugging, some methods of debugging manually and how to read error messages

## Header file:
* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions in this project

* `void positive_or_negative(int i);`
* `int largest_number(int a, int b, int c);`
* `void print_remaining_days(int month, int day, int year);`

## tests:
* [tests](./tests): Folder of some tests

## Tasks:
* **0.main.c**
	* [0.main.c](./0-main.c):  test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0

* **1-main.c**
	* [1-main.c](./1-main.c): Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop

* **2-largest_number.c**
	* [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c): prints the largest of three integers.

* **3-print_remaining_days.c**
	* [3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c): takes a date and prints how many days are left in the year, taking leap years into account
